Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    Time complexity is O(|V|) where |V| is the number of nodes,you need to traverse all nodes. 


4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    Space complexity is O(|V|) since at worst case you need to hold all vertices in the queue.

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    O(nLogn)

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
  O(1)
